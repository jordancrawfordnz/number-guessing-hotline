This was a hackdays project of mine to learn how [Plivo](https://plivo.com) works to link the web world with the phone world.

See [my blog post](https://jc.kiwi/web-and-phone/) about this for more information.

## Setup
Ensure NodeJS is installed on your system before beginning.

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `node phone_server.js`.

Optionally define the `PORT` environment variable to run on a different port, e.g.: port 80.
